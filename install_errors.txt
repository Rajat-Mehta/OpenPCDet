1. Go to this path: /venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/share/cmake/Caffe2/Caffe2Targets.cmake
Line No.73: 
INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS "-Wextra;-Wno-unused-parameter;-Wno-missing-field-initializers;-Wno-write-strings;-Wno-unknown-pragmas;-Wno-missing-braces;-fopenmp"

Remove "-Wall;"


2. 
The CUDA compiler

"/usr/bin/nvcc"
is not able to compile a simple test program.

Sol:
set(CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER "/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc")
This should be added before the line 5
'if (SPCONV_BuildCUDA)'
